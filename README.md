Raindrop is an app/webapp that provides easy access to a variety of sources for weather information, all from a single interface. The current version supports easy access to radar data from weather.gov.

# Future plans
There is satellite views available on nasa.gov that can likely be integrated into the app.

This app will be available online for Firefox OS.
